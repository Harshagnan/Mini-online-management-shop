# Mini-online-management-shop

This is a simple single-page Mini-Online-Management-Shop built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

1. Add new products with ID, name, category, and price
2. View all products in a dynamic catalog
3. Filter products by category
4. Search for products by ID
5. Remove products from the catalog

All data is stored using localStorage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.
No backend or external libraries are used â€” everything is handled on the frontend.
